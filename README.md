## What is this for?

Software engineering in ONS' DST department is a variable grade role, roughly aligned to the DDaT framework [Software Developer role](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#technical:-software-developer-). Our take on this is available on SharePoint. The DDaT framework role profile answers the questions:
* What is expected of you at your current grade in terms of skills, behaviours and knowledge?
* What should you be working towards to achieve the next grade up?

But how do you get from not knowing something, to knowing? Your learning pathway documents some of the ways (doing your job, attending conferences, shadowing other colleagues are some others).

## How to contribute

This repo holds a [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/ONSdigital/software-engineering-learning-pathway/wiki), which has some limitations, such as a single level structure, but is fairly low barrier to entry. We want you to contribute your links and advice on the page associated to the DDaT role profile skill area it is appropriate for (a tutorial, video or activity might be a good fit for multiple areas). We're going for a minimalist approach with this- entries subcategorised as *Introductory* and *Beyond*, and no more than a line or two of explanation.

Wiki pages can be edited in the page (perfect for those of you on-network) or the traditional git way, using an editor on your desktop of your choosing.

Please use [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to compose your welcome submissions.

## What happens next

As this is an semi-open wiki, we will look to periodically take a snapshot, check all the links and proofread the text, and publish it in a smarter format on GitHub pages, or Netlify or similar.
